Acknowledgements
================

Special thanks to the [Jison](http://zaach.github.com/jison/) project. Jison is a powerful JavaScript parser generator that sh.js uses, although in a very basic, clumsy fashion, to parse commands.

Thanks to the [node.js](http://nodejs.org) project. Node.js uses Google's blazing-fast V8 JavaScript virtual machine, adds APIs to interact with the operating system and is pleasant and fun to use.
